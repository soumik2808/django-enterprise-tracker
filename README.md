ðŸ”’ Disclaimer
This project simulates enterprise tools and workflows based on my past experience during second half of my Accenture days with confidential client projects.
Original work done with clients like Oracle or Accenture internal have been simulated to the best possible way.
Hence, dummy data and functionality have been used in this repository for learning and demonstration purposes.
